/*
    - Operating system is responsible for doing the commands from the c code
    - OS communicates with the processor: through machine language (instructions) predefined set
    - compiler changes c language to machine code
    - gcc open source compiler cross platform
    
    - linear programming (seq prog) all program written inside one file, one block
    - structural/functional/procedural programming; like c; composed of set of blocks SUA (single unit of action)
    - program in struct prog is the flow between units of action
    - OOP is better than struct prog when it comes to maintainance as time increases exponentially
      with number of functions and data volume being passed between functions
    - programming language is used as it's faster in development
    
    - C language is named after A, B languages
    - the first one to introduce variables and functions

    - IDE: integrated developing environment
    - editor: color and enhance code style
    - IDE links to the compiler

    - Syntax error: compilation error, code won't be compiled (degree 1)
    - warning: during compilation, code will run with risk of runtime error (degree 0)
    - runtime error: error causes program to fail, found by debugger and trace stack
    - logical error: program runs without error, but the result is incorrect

    - preprocessor: part of source file that communicates specific instructions to compiler
    
    - program variables are stored in stack memory by default (fixed size)
    - variable size memory assigned dynamically: heap

    - bit: smallest hardware unit of storage
    - byte: smallest unit of storage accessed by c (2/4 bytes for int) (review this part of lec ~2:20:00)
    - characteristics of stack variable: type, size, name, address, content
    - scope is related to stack memory, erase when it's no longer accesible
