- linked list have an overhead of storing pointers and no O(1) indexing -> O(n)
- a class can't have member attribute of its own type
- to be albe to insert from back in O(1) we need to store a pointer to tail
- double linked list is needed to access the previous node easily
- OS returns NULL in dynamic allocation when there is no memory
