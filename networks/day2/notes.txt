- ARP (address resolution protocol) table stores IP and MAC of devices we communicated with, created by OS
- packets contain source mac&IP - data - destination IP&mac
- destination mac is initiall filled with ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff in order to be broadcasted in the first time

- ping command communicates with the IP and receives a response to make sure we are both on the same network (echo request)
- ping TTL: time to live: number of packets hubs before it fails
- ping number of packets lost: weak network connectivity
- ping -n count of packets
- ping -t endless packets
- DOS attack: denial of service -> when requests fills the network card buffer 
- ping -l: size of packet

- 127.0.0.1 reserved IP for each card to refer to itself

- tcp/ip protocol: transimision control (full duplex)
- tcp header: packet information
- simplex: sending message from one device while all listen
- half duplex: devices sending and receiving while taking orders
- full duplex: sending and receiving at the same time

- tcp established with three-way handshake: SYN -> SYN ACK -> EST
    - sequential and ack increment by 1 after each packet

- ack replies with the smallest seq non-received

- udp: user datagram protocol: connectionless (no notification)
    - fast transimision, low relibility

- ports: logical address on the network card: each service uses one port, each port is used by one service at most

- application layer: 5th layer in the updated OSI?
- TLD: top level domains, URL domain under which websited domains are organized
    - ICAN is responsible for managing registrations

- url to ip is cached in ram
    - then in hosts file

- nslookup command: use dns to resolve url
